export const HERO_CONTENT = `I am a passionate FrontEnd developer with a talent for crafting responsive and maintainable web applications.With 4+ years of hands-on experience in modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Next, Redux, and a strong background in integrating RESTful APIs, I aim to leverage my skills to create innovative and user-centric solutions that enhance productivity and user engagement.`;
export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I am a  Software Engineer with a passion for crafting seamless, user-focused web applications that drive both business growth and customer satisfaction. With a solid foundation in React.js, Next.js, and state management tools like ContextAPI and Redux Toolkit, I specialize in building responsive and scalable solutions that deliver exceptional performance across devices.
Currently at Sparsh Communications, I focus on optimizing front-end performance using cutting-edge techniques like lazy loading, dynamic imports, and prefetching. I take pride in creating dynamic, accessible interfaces using React.js, Nextjs, Tailwind CSS, and robust design systems, ensuring compliance with WCAG guidelines for inclusivity.


Previously at HTC Global Services, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to build reusable React components, design intuitive user experiences, and integrate RESTful APIs for dynamic, data-driven web applications. My contributions led to significant improvements in productivity, user interaction speeds, and application maintainability.

In addition to professional roles, I have spearheaded innovative projects like a Traveller, Moboom, and an E-Commerce Platform, where I implemented advanced features such as search, filtering, and real-time updates, enhancing user engagement and functionality.
My technical skill set spans JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, Node.js, Redux and modern frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap. I’m also experienced with performance optimization, dynamic workflows, and Agile collaboration.
What excites me most is the opportunity to combine my technical expertise with creative problem-solving to deliver impactful solutions that meet both user needs and business objectives. When I’m not coding, I’m exploring new technologies, learning about design systems, or diving into a good tech blog.`;
